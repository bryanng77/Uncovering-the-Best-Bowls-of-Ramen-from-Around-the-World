# 🍜 Uncovering the Best Bowls of Ramen from Around the World

## Project Background
Ramen is more than just a meal; it’s a culinary experience that blends culture, flavors, and personal preference. As a Data Analyst with a deep love for ramen, I wanted to combine my passion for food with my analytical skills to uncover insights about the world’s best ramen.

This project leverages SQL and Power BI to analyze a comprehensive dataset of ramen reviews, covering brands, styles, countries, and ratings. The goal is to identify trends, determine the top-rated ramen brands, and explore how different styles and regions influence ramen quality.

As someone who loves both data and ramen, I often find myself exploring different brands and flavors, wondering which ones truly stand out. Every time I try a new ramen, I question:

🤔 "Is this one of the best?"

🤔 "How does it compare to others around the world?"

This curiosity sparked the idea for a data-driven approach to discovering the best ramen. As a Data Analyst, I believe insights hidden within data can help uncover patterns and trends that will allow me know which Ramen is the BEST!
